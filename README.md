# coding-challenges
repo for various algorithm tests and coding challenges
Some of these are complete, some are incomplete. Sources are mostly: Daily coding challenge email distribution list, Hackerrank, leetcode. 

I also use this repo when I need to quickly test that something is going to work the way that I expect it to work, so there are some weird little pointless files around.
